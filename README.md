# Email Agent Workshop

Build a personal AI Email Agent that automatically processes, labels, and drafts responses to incoming messages. You'll create the agent with Next.js, TypeScript, the Vercel AI SDK, and Neon Postgres.

By the end of the workshop, you'll have a fully working email assistant and gain practical experience building AI features you can include in future projects.

## Prerequisites

When it comes to assumptions & prerequisites, workshop attendees should have:

- Knowledge of git, building APIs, and writing server-side code with JavaScript/TypeScript
- Familiarity with command-line tools and installing Node.js packages

The workshop focuses exclusively on backend development and AI integration, so no frontend experience is required

## Workshop Structure

The workshop combines two types of activities:

- Conceptual overview: Explanations of key ideas you'll need to understand.
- Hands-on exercises: Guided activities where you'll apply what you've learned, with helpful code snippets provided.

## Workshop outline

- Introduction
- Exercise #0: Set up your development environment
- Conceptual Overview: Building an AI Workflow
- Exercise #1: Create an AI workflow with the AI SDK by Vercel, Neon Postgres, and Drizzle ORM
- Conceptual Overview: Webhooks
- Exercise #2: Set up webhooks for testing
- Conceptual Overview: Google Apps Scripts
- Exercise #3: Set up Google Apps Scripts to forward email threads

## Introduction

If you've used AI apps like ChatGPT, Claude, Le Chat, Google Gemini, or others, you'll notice that they all offer a similar user experience where you:

1. Initiate a conversation
2. Only do one task at a time

AI Agents are the next evolution of AI apps. Since they will allow you to delegate tasks to an AI and have them done in the background.

Some example use cases of AI Agents are:

- Coding
- Support
- Deep Research

There's also a lot of potential for personal AI agents. This workshop will show you how to build a personal AI Email Agent that automatically processes, labels, and summarizes incoming emails.

The goal of this workshop is to give you a solid foundation to build your own AI Agents. The concepts you'll learn can be applied to other AI Agent projects.
